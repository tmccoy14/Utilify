# Utilify

Utilify is an application that sends weekly updates of the utility bill. This was created because my roommates and I often forget when to pay the bill or what the current amount is. Utilify sends updates on the gas, water, and electric bills to our phones each Sunday morning. The updates consist of what the current amount is and what project end of the month total is going to be.

# MORE UPDATES TO COME
