Utilify is an application that was written to send weekly updates of the utility bill. This was created because my roommates and I often forget when to pay the bill or what the current amount is. Utilify sends updates on the gas, water, and electric bills to our phones each Sunday morning. Utilify is written in Python, hosted on Github, triggered by Circle CI, and notifications sent by AWS SNS.
